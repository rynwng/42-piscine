# 42-piscine

CODE_rush03.c has the breakdown of the code, complete with comments to explain its semantics.

main.c contains a sample main function. The content of the main function itself does not matter too much because 42 will change it anyway.

ft_putchar.c contains the same function used for some/most of day03 and day04 exercises.

rush03.c contains the core function that creates the rectangle, with the 'A', 'B', 'C', and ' ' characters as specified in the specs for the group project.
